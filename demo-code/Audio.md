On the Raspberry Pi there are two options to play audio:

HDMI and Analogue

Follow the following instructions to enable audio playback via either media:

amixer cset numid=3 2

The default setting is 0 which is automatic.
Setting the output to 1 switches to analogue (headphone jack). 
Here the output is being set to 2, which is HDMI.
